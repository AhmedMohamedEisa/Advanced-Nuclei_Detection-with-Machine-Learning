Project Architecture
Overview
This project utilizes a U-Net convolutional neural network architecture for the segmentation of cell nuclei from histopathological images. The system is designed to process images, detect nuclei boundaries, and segment them with high precision.

Components
The project is composed of several key components:

Data Preprocessing Module
Normalization: Standardizes the pixel values across all images.
Augmentation: Enhances the dataset with altered versions of images to improve model robustness.
U-Net Model
Input Layer: Accepts preprocessed images.
Downsampling Path: Captures features and context.
Bottleneck: Processes the most abstracted features.
Upsampling Path: Recovers spatial information for precise localization.
Output Layer: Produces the segmentation map of nuclei.
Training Pipeline
Loss Functions: Utilizes a combination of binary cross-entropy and Dice similarity coefficient for training.
Optimization Algorithm: Employs Adam optimizer for adjusting weights.
Evaluation Framework
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Intersection over Union (IoU) for performance assessment.
Validation Set: A subset of the data used to tune model parameters and prevent overfitting.
Post-processing
Thresholding: Converts the probability maps to binary masks.
Labeling: Identifies and labels individual nuclei.
Workflow
Raw images are loaded and preprocessed.
The U-Net model processes the images through its layers.
Post-processing is applied to the model's output.
Evaluation metrics are calculated.
Directory Structure
/src: Contains the source code for the model and utilities.
/data: Holds the dataset and preprocessing scripts.
/models: Stores the trained models and weights.
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and testing.
