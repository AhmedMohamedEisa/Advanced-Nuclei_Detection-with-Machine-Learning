Data Directory Structure
We have organized the data into separate directories within the data/ folder of this repository:

/data/raw/: Contains the original, unprocessed image files.
/data/processed/: Stores images after preprocessing steps like normalization and augmentation.
Obtaining the Data
The dataset for nuclei detection is sourced from the 2018 Data Science Bowl on Kaggle. Due to the size of the dataset, it is not included directly in this repository.

Instructions for Accessing the Dataset:
Visit the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2018 competition page.
Join the competition to gain access to the dataset.
Download the dataset onto your local machine.
Preparing the Data
Before using the data for training the model, perform the following preprocessing steps:

Run the normalization script to standardize image intensities: python scripts/normalize.py.
Execute the augmentation script to enhance the dataset: python scripts/augment.py.
