Algorithms Used
U-Net Convolutional Neural Network
Overview
The U-Net architecture is a powerful convolutional neural network specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a contracting path to capture context and an expansive path that enables precise localization.

Core Components
Convolutional Layers: Utilize kernels to extract feature maps from images.
Activation Function (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity to the learning process.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality and retain important features.
Upconvolution (Transposed Convolution): Expands the feature maps to enable precise segmentation.
Special Features
Skip Connections: Combine features from different layers to preserve spatial context.
Data Augmentation: Mitigate overfitting and improve model generalizability by artificially expanding the dataset.
Training Algorithm
Loss Function
Binary Cross-Entropy: Measures the pixel-wise difference between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.
Dice Coefficient: Quantifies the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.
Optimization
Adam Optimizer: An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm designed for training deep neural networks efficiently.
Post-processing Techniques
Thresholding
Converts the model's probabilistic output into a binary image, separating nuclei from the background.
Morphological Operations
Cleans up the segmentation result, refining the shapes of detected nuclei and separating touching objects.
