Project Scope
The project focuses on automated nuclei detection using machine learning, aiming to improve precision and efficiency in biomedical image analysis.

Algorithm Selection
We chose the U-Net architecture for its success in medical image segmentation tasks, leveraging its symmetrical structure for accurate nuclei detection.

Data Handling
Data preprocessing was designed to maximize model performance, including normalization and augmentation to address variability in histopathological images.

Model Complexity
We balanced the model's complexity to optimize for both accuracy and computational efficiency, ensuring it could be deployed in diverse environments.

Performance Metrics
Selection of metrics like F1-score and IoU was based on their relevance to segmentation tasks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of model accuracy.

Post-processing
Post-processing steps, including thresholding and morphological operations, were designed to refine the segmentation output from the U-Net model.

Software and Tools
We opted for Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for their robustness, extensive libraries, and community support in machine learning development.
